Example of using project panama to call grpcurl (go) from java.


== Pre-requisites

* Java 19
* Gradle 8.0.2 or later
* grpcurl installed as shared library from https://github.com/ericdriggs/grpcurl



== Intellij setup

https://nljug.org/intellijidea/how-to-enable-java-preview-features-and-run-code-from-intellij-idea[enable preview in java compiler]


== Usage




== jextract options

    jextract --source -t com.github.fullstorydev.grpcurl \
    -I /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include \
    -I /usr/local/include/grpcurl \
    -l grpcurl \
    --header-class-name grpcurl_h \
    grpcurl.h


== TODO

* docs for osx and linux
* figure out how to load dylib as a library instead of requiring hard path
* jna/jni example since preview features require jvm flag --enable-preview
* example integration test with mock grpc server
* see if osx panama can be generalized to linux
